# Exploring digital health interventions for pregnant women
 Hypertension is the most common medical problem encountered during pregnancy and remains an important cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. It complicates up to 15% of pregnancies and accounts for about a quarter of all prenatal hospital admissions. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy encompass a range of disorders for which pre-eclampsia represents the greatest potential risk. Early in the first trimester, blood pressure is lowered by active vasodilation achieved through the action of local mediators such as prostacyclin and nitric oxide. This drop in blood pressure primarily affects diastolic blood pressure, with a drop of 10 mm Hg seen between weeks 13 and 20. Normal week of pregnancy. Blood pressure then rises gradually until delivery, when it reaches pre-pregnancy levels. Blood pressure usually falls immediately after delivery and rises during her first five days after delivery. Even women who had normal blood pressure during pregnancy may experience transient high blood pressure in the early postpartum period. . This may reflect some degree of vasomotor instability. Pre-eclampsia usually occurs after the 20th week of pregnancy and is a multisystem disease. It is classically defined as the triad of hypertension, edema, and proteinuria. 
## Telemonitoring in pregnancies
A prospective device for supporting pregnant women at high risk of developing pre-eclampsia (HRPE) is telemonitoring. This refers to the use of information technology to monitor patients remotely. HRPE women take their blood pressure readings home and record self-reported symptoms related to pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, and the data is transmitted in real-time to clinicians. Telemonitoring is a promising tool for improving health outcomes in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia and improving the quality and coordination of care in a cost-effective and scalable manner. Telemonitoring can generate clinical alerts based on a patient's blood pressure readings and symptoms, and send personalized self-care her messages. This could lead to early detection of alarming increases in blood pressure, leading to early intervention such as medication, hospitalization, and childbirth. Additionally, telemonitoring can ensure clinical monitoring and self-care support for pregnant women with HRPE, reducing anxiety and stress associated with pregnancy and hospitalization. Most telemonitoring interventions have been conducted in high-income countries such as the United Kingdom as part of clinical and proof-of-concept studies. These studies reported potential benefits of telemonitoring during pregnancy. This includes fewer hospital visits, improved blood pressure control and reduced costs. This reliance on prenatal care allowed pregnant women to miss signs of health problems between physical visits by community health workers and the introduction of white-coat or masked hypertension. Self-monitoring also plays a role in the prevention of conditions such as white coat hypertension and masked hypertension in pregnant women.
WHO recommends home blood pressure monitoring of pregnant women with HRPE/E to detect changes in blood pressure between antenatal visits and ensure continuity of care.

The high maternal mortality rate from pre-eclampsia/eclampsia is due to the lack of early detection and treatment of pregnant women at high risk of pre-eclampsia. Remote monitoring is one of the tools to support pregnant women at high risk of pre-eclampsia. Evidence on the use and effectiveness of telemonitoring for pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited, and our understanding of the processes and mechanisms by which interventions work in LMICs is limited. Telemedicine monitoring significantly reduced postnatal readmissions and increased quality-adjusted life years. Telemedicine monitoring was cheap and cost-saving. Telemedicine monitoring remains cost-effective. Telemedicine monitoring remained cost-effective even when postpartum readmission rates were ≥3.0% with standard monitoring.
## Testing effectiveness of use of mobile health
 A study was designed to identify and examine potential factors that influenced the use of mobile health technology and adherence to postnatal monitoring of pre-eclampsia-related symptoms in women. A sample of 50 women participated in the study. Two participants were excluded, leaving a total sample size of 48 women. The user received an m-Health device to monitor her blood pressure, weight, heart rate and oxygen saturation over the course of two weeks. Non-users did not receive the equipment. A nurse call center monitored device readings and contacted participants as needed. Both groups completed the initial and follow-up studies. On average, women who chose to use mobile health technology had lower levels of perceived technology barriers, higher scores for mitigation, and higher perceived benefits of technology compared to non-users. In addition, when tracking users, there were no statistical differences between full and partial users in terms of perceived ease of use, perceived satisfaction, and perceived usefulness. This study provided a basis for restructuring the treatment management of women with postpartum hypertensive disorders using m-health technology.  
## Investigating the use of telemedicine to enable remote consultations between pregnant women. 
Most articles focus on predicting adverse maternal outcomes, data collection and decision support, diagnostic and clinical decision support. Telemedicine is widely used in high-income countries to provide a variety of obstetric services, including: Using videoconferencing as an alternative to face-to-face visits, conducting home monitoring, facilitating remote specialist consultation, early postpartum follow-up, and access to lactation consultants. Telemedicine for pregnant women at HRPE/E in low- and middle-income countries enables remote monitoring and consultation between pregnant women and health care providers. Increasing numbers of women giving birth suffer from high morbidity and mortality. 
Conclusion: Mobile health technology can help women with pre-eclampsia to accurately control and monitor their blood pressure during pregnancy and postpartum, alerting them to signs of worsening disease.
